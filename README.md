# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Bose
The Indian market is sensitive to prices and demands affordable and feature-rich variants from brands like JBL compared to luxury-based audio solutions.
1. Introduction & Business Problem 1.1 Overview of Bose’s Presence in India
Bose Corporation, a world-famous brand, has been famous for its high-end audio products, top-notch noise cancellation technology, and high-end sound systems for a long time. Although it has made a strong foothold in markets such as the United States, Europe, and Japan, its growth in India has been quite sluggish in comparison to other players.
India is amongst the fastest-developing audio marketplaces, driven by growing popularity for wireless earbuds, noise-canceling headphones, and intelligent audio solutions. The Indian market is sensitive to prices and demands affordable and feature-rich variants from brands like JBL compared to luxury-based audio solutions.
Bose, a brand associated with high-end prices, is heavily competed against by brands such as Sony, JBL, Sennheiser, and domestic brands like Noise, Boat, and Boult Audio that offer value-for-money products at aggressive prices and promotional strategies.
1.2 The Problem Statement: Why is Bose Struggling in India?
Despite its reputation for high-quality sound, Bose has been facing major challenges in the Indian market, including:
1. High Competition from Budget-Friendly Brands:
 Sony, JBL, and Sennheiser companies rule the high-end audio space, providing the same or better features at an affordable price.
 Indian brands such as Noise, Boat, and Boult Audio have won over mass-market customers with affordable, feature-rich offerings.
2. Customer Service & After-Sales Issues:
 Indian customers have high expectations for post-sales service, particularly in technology products.
 Several Bose users have complained of poor service, slow support, and unresponsive service centers, which has led to negative word-of-mouth marketing.
3. Premium Pricing in a Price-Sensitive Market:
 The average Indian consumer prioritizes affordability over brand prestige.
 Although Bose products are high-end, most customers believe that the price-to-feature ratio is
not worth the price compared to other brands such as Sony, JBL, and Noise.
4. Limited Marketing & Localized Product Offerings:
2
     Brands such as Boat and Noise have competitive influencer marketing strategies for youth and middle-class consumers. Bose's marketing has been less India- centric and more international, which has made it less attractive to the younger Indian population.
1.3 The Bose-Noise Collaboration: A Strategic Move?
To offset the shrinking sales and restore consumer confidence, Bose has partnered with Noise, one of the top Indian audio companies, to launch a new range of affordable earbuds.
Why Noise?
 Noise is a market leader in India's affordable wireless earbuds segment.
 It possesses deep local market insight and a developed consumer base.
 Through collaboration, Bose can reach the "affordable premium" space and tap budget-conscious
consumers.
The Big Question:
 Will this collaboration help Bose regain its lost market share?
 How do consumers perceive the Bose-Noise partnership?
 What are the key factors Bose needs to address to make this partnership successful?

Conclusion: Understanding the Decline
Bose's decline in India is not merely because of growing competition but also because it is not keeping pace with changing customer needs. Though it still carries a premium perception for sound, its premium branding, poor after-sales support, and outmoded market stance have prompted Indian consumers to low-cost and customer-focused players like Noise, JBL, and Sony.
With data insights and sentiment analysis, we have found three major reasons for the failure of Bose in India:
Customer service dissatisfaction: Ineffective responses, poor support, and warranty/return issues. Price imbalance: Excessive price without commensurate service or innovation.
Shift in consumer dynamics: Indian consumers increasingly prioritize value-for-money, upgrade frequency, and service quality over brand heritage.
