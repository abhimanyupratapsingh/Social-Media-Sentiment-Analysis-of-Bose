This project analyzes the business challenges faced by **Bose Corporation** in the Indian audio market, focusing on price sensitivity, rising competition, customer service gaps, and its recent collaboration with local audio brand **Noise**. Using social media and e-commerce sentiment data, the project evaluates public perception, identifies critical pain points, and proposes a comprehensive comeback strategy for Bose in India.

---

## Project Objectives

- Investigate why Bose is struggling to grow in the Indian market
- Analyze consumer sentiment toward Bose vs. Noise using NLP techniques
- Evaluate the strategic value of the Bose–Noise collaboration
- Recommend actionable strategies for pricing, service, product design, and market positioning

## Business Context

India is one of the fastest-growing audio markets in the world, but it is also **highly price-sensitive**. While Bose is recognized globally for premium sound and noise-canceling products, brands like **JBL, Sony, Boat, Noise**, and **Boult** dominate in India due to affordability, aggressive marketing, and localized offerings.

Despite superior sound quality, **Bose's high pricing, weak after-sales service, and limited localization** have hindered its growth.
