local,R S Nishit,4,Decent TWS in this Price Segment,Audio quality is very balanced and people who prefer more bass might be but disappointed as this not too noisy. Very light weight and comfortable fit. Noise did a good job by Collaborating with Bose. Value for money as this comes with bank offer and a great discount. Bluetooth connectivity is too quick and can pair with two devices at one go. Customisation in the app is super helpful. ANC and spatial audio Functionality is top-notch. 4 star is because of No Dolby Audio technology. Battery back up is too good and comes with super fast charge. Design and build type is worth spending as it comes with the retro dial shape design with an LED status bar. ,Reviewed in India on 8 March 2025,Verified Purchase,"Expertly tuned audio with Sound by Bose, powered by the smartest audio tech, a…",,,,,,
local,Karan Kapoor,5,a surprising winner,"The Noise Master Buds genuinely surprised me ‚Äî and in the best way possible. Noise partnering with Bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. I honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an Indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. The bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. Whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is another highlight ‚Äî it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. Noise claims up to 49dB of noise cancellation, and while I haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. Even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work. The design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. The touch controls are responsive, and I love how you can customize them through the Noise Audio App. Battery life is impressive too ‚Äî I got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. The dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle. Overall, the Noise Master Buds feel like a big step forward for Indian audio brands. With Bose's tuning and solid features like ANC, spatial audio, and LDHC support, they easily compete with more expensive options.

local,Ganesh,3,"Great Sound & Premium Design, but Disappointing Build Quality","I recently tried these earbuds, and while they have some strong points, they also come with a major drawback. Pros: ‚Ä¢ The sound quality is good, delivering clear audio with decent bass and crisp highs. Whether for music or calls, the performance was satisfactory. ‚Ä¢ The design looks premium, with a sleek and stylish finish that gives them a high-end feel. Cons: ‚Ä¢ The build quality is very poor. The materials feel flimsy, and they don‚Äôt seem durable enough for long-term use. After a short period, I noticed signs of wear and potential durability issues. Overall, if you prioritize sound and aesthetics, these might work for you. However, if durability is a concern, you might want to consider other options. Rating: 3/5.

local,VG,1,Worthless,POOR QUALITY! Not sure why BOSE would tie up with these nincompoops. These ear buds are not even worth half the price they are being sold at. The only thing good is probably the looks and that is all. The problem started with the launch itself where they wrongly represented the discounts. Then you have no choice to return these but only exchange them. They clearly know that their product is bad & that is why they need to do all these theatrics.
