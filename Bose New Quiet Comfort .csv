 Updated to 1 Star on 12/08. DO NOT BUY. Old-Spectacular! Mind-blowing experience,"Well, i may have over stepped my joy and ignored few key concerns when I wrote the first review. I have now reduced the rating to 1 Star, after encountering a few basic things that these Ultras miserably fail at.
1. When you insert these buds into your ears, randomly either one of them will not connect! Has happened many-many times. Beyond frustrating; you need to put the buds back in the case, and sit and hope that the problem is solved. A 1000rs earbuds which i have from Tozo , seamlessly connects with my phone!

2.when you use multi point connection with a laptop , even after u keep the earbuds back in the case, the connection with laptop cannot be disconnected!!! I use ‘forget device’ option on the laptop .. each time i need to disconnect. Again, these things are basics 101!! I have the Buds Live and multi point works so intuitively on that.

The sound quality is sublime 10/10
ANC is 8/10 - removed 2 point2 due to ‘white noise’
Connectivity: 1/10

Honestly, id be better off with AirPods 2 Pro or Sony XM5s . Don’t buy the Ultras right now , wait and research if Bose has fixed and then decide.

Extremely disappointed, definitely avoid until Bose does the right thing and corrects the basics, Ultra name is a joke.
Just a few firmware updates should be able to fix and hope Bose does that and soon, as this is a global issue.

Old review:
This is my first purchase of a premium segment earbuds, and i am absolutely mind blown!! The Sound quality is something you need to hear to believe.

And ANC? What Bose has done with ANC is scary! The earbuds with full ANC on would make you feel that you are ‘alone’ , even if you are at a busy, noisy office. My focus has a new aid! Pure wizardry.
With the new Firmware update, Bose has enabled multiple connectivity. But the implementation is poor, has a few minor bugs and must be fixed with a next update, but not a deal breaker for me.

Don’t get carried away with lower ratings, if Top class Sound and ANC is your priority, then close your eyes and purchase, nothing else comes close.
I bought this over the Bose Ultra Headphones due to convenience, I don’t regret one bit.",1.0 out of 5 stars
 Worst earphones...,"Bose is very famous for sound quality. It does not mean that it should not concentrate on call quality which will be heard by the other side. WORST WORST mic quality and it picks ambient sound and amplifies to the other side. Even at pin drop silent in my room, it picks and amplifies the fan sound to the other side. All these happening in Noise cancelation mode.....

Then I consulted their main service centre in Mumbai. It was cherry on top. Their service and attitude are worser than their products....totally pathetic experience.

DONT GO FOR THIS PRODUCT",1.0 out of 5 stars
Please don't buy it ,"Good ANC active noise cancellation, good for hearing or watching movies etc.but...................
But
But

When you come to the reality you will face 1 major problem that is for making call, the opposite person will hear lot and lot of disturbance which will case the other person very very deficult, please don't buy it if you are going to make lots of call with this, service is also bad they didn't even check and send me back and telling me that is no problem, I told them you customer service centre person was the another person to be victim, after taking to the custom support they told me please take off this boss head set and talk to me, I told them I want my refund indont want this this product is defective but they told me this option is not available.

so it's your choice, you want to buy it or 🚫

My suggestion please don't buy this go for Sennheiser or Jabra",
,"I have been an Amazon Prime member for years now but the recent purchase made me realize the recent evolutions in product support policies especially for a niche item such as Bose Top End Earbuds has reduced the experience and platform is a pure marketplace. The Bose Ultra Quiet Comfort earbuds have been problematic since day one. Frequent Blue Tooth Connectivity Drops, Re Connection difficulties, Erratic Battery Back up and Low Call Volume level means the product is useless on both counts music and calls. Now I have had a quiet comfort classic model for years now so having such a product quality is a big let down. Now invoking my Amazon Prime Status was easier said than done as I has greeted with a wry monotone of visting the service center for a 2 day old product. While the agent was courteous but clealy they have been provided zero fleaxibility to treat the discerning customers differently. I do hope the Amazon Customer Support team will review this review and fix it one way or the other.",
,"I didn’t expect Amazon to wash their hand off after sending a defective product. I received my Boss ear buds and was super excited to try it. After pairing the buds, I realized one side is not working at all. When I called Amazon customer care. They did not replace the item but told me to contact Bose customer support which is not very convenient. Bose customer support helped with the pick up of the product and sent me a message that they have begun the repair of the device. Why would I pay such a huge amount for the device and then go for a repaired product. Now I’m wasting my weekends calling Amazon and Bose to follow up on the defective product. Wish u luck if you are buying the same product.",
,"Absolutely run for your life if someone suggests you buying this earbuds. Worst product and lately bose has lost ethics. Just to stay in the market and compete with apple they have introduced this product but its long way out competing with apple. Mic quality is at its worst and keeps disconnecting sometimes if you move your head. I took my earbud to service centre as no one hear me clearly when I use this earbuds for making phone calls. Technician said its the default quality of mic and should not expect more. Why would bose release such a crap product when their competitors are selling better earbuds for 1/10th price. Please help yourself by buying apple earbuds or any other earbud for that matter and save yourself some regret. Zero value for money, Fit is average, Appearance is very bulky and Stability is average.",
,"This model has a built-in problem, that the left earbud will produce a mosquito-like noise which is super annoying. also the audio flickers sometimes, you must prove it to the service center.
This item is not replaceable on Amazon, you should take this to the service center on your own.
but the service center guy will simply tell you like ""No I cannot hear any noise like that""
Amazon will simply abandon you by saying ""We cannot do anything from our side"".
I read the discussions on Reddit that many customers have this left earbud noise issue,
If this product has a design issue then why bose is selling it to the customers?
already I have quite comfort headphones and Bluetooth speakers.
for a regular customer like me, this is unacceptable.",
,"The product didn't work out of the box. The left ear bud didn't connect in the first place. Once it did, it was having poor audio quality and constant dropping of audio connection.

Took it to the customer service centre in Delhi and they asked to leave the product for their ""inspection"". It's been 4 days now and neither does the service centre answer emails, nor do they pick up their phones.

BOSE!!!!! DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMER CARE IN INDIA.",
,"Audio quality is excellent but terrible connectivity and call quality. I am not sure if it is something to do with iPhones. I used Sony xm5 and. AirPods Pro 2. Sony has amazing features and audio for music and calling but poor fit. So I moved to AirPods . They have excellent fit but not so great audio quality for listening music. After using all the 3 I can easily conclude that AirPods Pro 2 are the best if you are someone who use earphones for different situations like workouts, office calls or listening music casually",
,"It has only one day of purchasing Ultra Bluetooth earbuds , there are serious connections issues on this ear bud , reached to customer care of Amazon who have conveniently shrugged off to Bose customer care.
Battery life of buds also drains very quickly.
Don’t buy.",
,"So finally the Bose qc ultra earbuds!!

Firstly, thanks to Amazon prime day sale got the ultra for the price of previous gen qc2. Great value for money.

The pros:
1. Very comfortable fit
2. Well rounded, great sound (ofcourse)
3. Top notch ANC
4. Easy and hassle free connectivity to ios devices

The cons:
1. No multi point connectivity - can connect to only one device at a time
2. No wireless charging (which wasnt a deal breaker for me)

Overall, really happy with the purchase. I was using airpods first gen for almost 2 years and then upgraded to airpods pro first gen. Was very happy with airpods but being a Bose fan and somebody who keeps a check on latest what Bose has to offer i thought of giving it a try. And oh boy! No regrets at all.",
,Mic was faulty and call quality was below standard. No support from Amazon for replacement. Product sent to service centre and no response from them for long period. Even after constant follow up the level of response is embarrassing. Buy products from Amazon only if replacement warranty is there.,
,One of the earbuds not working. Amazon refused to replace or refund. They blame me that someone came to our house and we tried to return a different product which is insane. It is better to buy electronics product from authorised shop rather than buying it from Amazon. Now I have to run for the replacement from Bose service center.,
,"I purchased the Bose Earbuds on May 6, 2023, expecting premium quality and reliability from such a reputed brand. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from satisfactory. Here’s a breakdown of my journey with the product:

- First Issue (6 Months): The earbuds stopped working entirely within six months of purchase. Thankfully, Bose replaced the product under warranty. While I appreciated the replacement, it raised questions about the durability of the product.

- Second Issue (After Replacement): Six months after receiving the replacement, the earbuds started showing charging issues. Despite careful usage, the charging case would not charge the earbuds properly, rendering them almost unusable.

- Customer Support Response: Today, I contacted Bose customer support hoping for a resolution. Unfortunately, the response was disheartening. I was informed that the product is non-serviceable, and the only option was to purchase a new Bose product with a 10% discount. This means I invested in a premium product and could only use it effectively for 1.5 years before it became useless.

While the sound quality of Bose products is commendable, the poor durability and unsatisfactory post-purchase support are unacceptable, especially for a premium-priced item. I now feel that my investment in Bose was a waste, leaving me with no working earbuds and no clear way forward. I expected better from a brand of this caliber.

Recommendation: Think twice before purchasing if you're looking for longevity and reliable customer support.",
,"I have owned at least 5 to 6 products from bose over last 20 years and I used to adore the brand.
But recently when by bose quietcomfort earbuds started malfunctioning and I visited their service center in bangalore India I was shocked.
It seems all their earbuds are un serviceable and if it malfunctions, and someone like me is unlucky to have the issue just after the warranty period, service center is asking to upgrade to the new pair of earbuds at 10%, something which is directly available on Amazon.
Also I happened to meet at least 3 customers with the exact same issue, and everyone appeared ro helpless after paying a premium price for their product and getting the worst possible service and treatment from the outsourced service center.
Additionally bose policies for replacement or repair are extremely discriminating from region to region.
In short it was a extremely disappointing experience and is not advisable to invest in bose products in India, considering their current support structure and quality of products.",
," am a die hard fan of Bose for years. The quality of this product is really bad. When connected to phone or laptop the audio of calls is so low that u can barely hear the other person. On top of that the noise cancelling in calls barely exists. My nose sound sport is 200% higher in volume at 50% volume levels. What a waste of money.

Update: wore the headphones on 8 hour car journey. The volume was full and I still could hear my fellow passenger talking through out the car journey even at immersive option.

Second reason for dislike is that while people are raving about the comfort, I still get pain even after wearing it for 30 mins. This is after trying all combinations of tips. I prefer air pod pro any day.

Complete waste of money. Will try and sell these",
,"Got the QC Ulta II for Christmas '23, and the battery drains extremely fast! Might be the worst battery life I've come across on any earbuds. All features are moot when the device is unusable.

Unfortunately for me the charging station was also faulty. It hadn't even been 1-day of opening the box that everything just fell apart. Anyways, turns out this is a MASSIVE Problem worldwide with the Bose QC Ultra's - One of the earbuds just gives up within a year + insane battery issues.

Just wanted to warn everyone on getting the QC Ultra's - Do your research first!

This is an expensive pair of earbuds to get a faulty piece on, and the replacement / refund policies on electronics (even Bose) are dismal in India.",
,"Bose QC ultra earbuds have an inherent fault where the Left earbud (in MANY cases) is the primary problem. There is a slight buzzing sound (like when a mosquito passes near one' ear) audible when the noise cancellation is On and no song is being played. This fault is apparently observed by many users globally, many reviews and complaint on reddit and YouTube by various users.
Returning my purchase, and request all to be aware of this issue. The sound can be very irritating for those who are buying it for its ANC capabilities, although I have to admit the ANC is very good on this device.
Had it not been for this constant buzzing sound, I would have kept these earbuds.
Also, returning is a bit of struggle as Amazon demands a denial of replacement letter from Bose Service center... So yeah please be cautious.",
,"If the warranty is finished, there is no service available for earbuds. You have to throw it in waste bin. I purchased the earbuds 2 years back and now the right ear bud is not working. Sent it to Bose authorised service centre and they are saying it is not repairable. I literally lost 26k. Very disappointed ",
,"Coming from Pixel buds pro and SonY HM4 , this is worst product and totally surprising suppose to be the best in noise cancellation , the call quality and noise when on phone calls and outdoors is worst I need to switch to phone everytime a call comes in.

Have sent in for repairs they just sent it back updating the firmware they didn't bother asking what's the issue.

Bose has long way to go from service in India.",
,"I am disappointed with the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra earbuds. For a top tier product, I expect them to perform better than they do, and after only 2 days there is a surprisingly long list of obvious issues.

After only two days, the issues are annoying that I have already stopped using them. So yes, I will be returning them to Amazon for a refund.

First, I do have experience with top tier noise cancelling headphones and earbuds.
These were to replace my Sony WF-1000XM4 which I really liked for the 3 years until they died. So I do know what to expect from top tier wireless noise cancelling earbuds. The older Sony earbuds do not have any of the issues I see in the newer Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds.
I also own a set of Bose QuietComfort 35 II over ear headphones for about 5 years. These are great headphones with none of the issues that I have found with the newer, but not better, Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds.
I am not promoting these products, but they are a point of reference when discussing the many issues I have experienced.

So here are the issues / annoyances / quirks that I have seen in ONLY 2 days of use:

The controls are very laggy in both the app and tapping the earbuds - such as single tap to pause music playback. It seems you have to wait quite a long time for the command to happen. With lag such a long lag I often repeat the command only to discover that it now does the command twice. Very annoying, and not something I have ever experienced with other wireless earbuds. With other earbuds, you tap to pause - you immediately hear the confirmation sound without this pronounced delay, so in my experience this is an issue limited to this product. This is NOT top tier product performance.

When I take them out of the charging case, it is not uncommon for one of them to not connect. So I have to figure out that one is not working, and put it back in the charging case and remove it again to get it to connect. It has happened several times in the two days since I got them, and it is very annoying. Again, not something I have ever experienced with other wireless earbuds, and certainly should not be happening with a top tier product.

I can be listening to music then all of the sudden the music stops. My phone app shows the music still playing, and thinks it is still connected to the earbuds, but none of the controls in the Bose app or by tapping work, so it appears that the earbuds had frozen. Only solution is to put them back in the charging case, , and then take them out to reconnect to the phone. FYI - I have a Samsung S23 Ultra which is fully updated and this does not happen with my other wireless headphones and earbuds. Again, this is certainly not top tier performance.

They have 3 modes (immersive, quiet, and aware). Quiet and Aware both have the same frequency response which is very bassy, and you need to adjust bass down because the excessive bass is annoying and fatiguing. Not really a problem right? Wrong because the Immersive mode has a completely different frequency response (much less bass and much brighter), so Immersive needs a small bass boost. The app does not allow for a different EQ setting for each mode, so switching from Immersive to either Quiet or Aware means a BIG change in sound - one that you like and one that you dislike -so each time you change modes you need to go into the settings and adjust the EQ every time. On my other headphones and earbuds, I never noticed a change in the frequency response when changing modes. Again, not what I call top tier performance - quite frankly the Quiet and Aware frequency responses should be the same as the Immersive which is the better of the two.

Wind noise is not a problem with small breeze and seems to be compensated for, but when wind gets over about 15 mph / 22 kph the wind noise is quite apparent. This is true in both Quiet and Immersive modes. And in Aware mode the wind noise is extremely excessive but this is to be expected. This wind noise is clearly coming from the noise cancelling because it is clearly air rushing past a microphone which is very different from wind noise on earbuds with no noise cancelling. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds have no ""off"" mode, no manual wind compensation - no controls on the completely automatic and always on noise cancelling. So in windy conditions it is impossible to eliminate this earbud generated wind noise. Therefore, these are not usable for bike rides or on moderately windy days. My old Sony SF-1000XM4 have a wind noise suppression option which works reasonably well, and the Sony also has an off mode so it can work without noise cancellation which is the source of the wind noise. My old Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones have a low noise cancelling setting which eliminates wind noise (not available on these earbuds), and the headphones also have a noise cancelling off mode. So these QuietComfort Ultra earbuds again falls short in comparison to other top tier products.

Just a note on wind noise - My Bose QuietComfort 35-II over ear headphones are perfect in windy conditions with the low noise cancelling mode - in fact, they are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever used outside in wind. So why that option is not available on these newer models is a mystery to me.

Another note on wind noise - I ride my bike every day with earbuds which is an extreme test on wind noise suppression for noise cancelling headphone and earbuds. My Sony WF-1000XM4 were fine. My old Bose QuietComfort 35-II headphones were fine with noise cancelling on low (but can't were a helmet). The new Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds are not useable on a bike because the wind noise is very loud and drowns out the music. They are also not useable on days with winds higher than 20 kph which is normal here in Western Canada.

On the plus side ... the earbuds are comfortable, secure, and sound good when the bass is fixed in the EQ. Battery life is pretty much exactly 4 hours in immersive at about 50% volume, which matches the specs.

On the plus side ... I really like the Immersive mode. It is impressive and very nice. I just wish I could have it without so many other issues.

For my case, I use earbuds almost entirely outside, and rarely use them inside. So I would not use the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds on many days because of the wind noise issue. Can you imagine ... check the weather for wind speed to decide if I can use my earbuds today?

Therefore, I feel that the Bose needs to fix these issues with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds before I can seriously call them a top tier product. As they stand now, in this price point, there are many other better options.

I will be returning these to Amazon for a refund.",
